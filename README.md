# Graph Traversal Analyzer

Traversal analysis and diagnostic tooling for Gremlin-style graph queries.

## Goal

Provide structural inspection and heuristic reasoning about traversal complexity, inefficiency patterns, and potential performance risks.

## Scope

Initial focus is traversal step modeling and analysis rather than execution.
